\qns{Thevenin Equivalence}

\begin{enumerate}

\itemWhat does it mean for two circuits to be equivalent?

\ans{

This means the IV relationships are the same at the same two terminals in each circuit.
}

\itemSuppose we have a circuit that we have abstracted away, and we have output nodes A and B. What components are included in a Thevenin equivalent circuit?

\ans{

A voltage source and resistor in series.
}

\itemHow do you construct a Thevenin equivalent circuit?

\ans{

First, measure the open circuit voltage across nodes A and B. This is the Thevenin voltage. To find the Thevenin resistence, first "zero out any independent sources, then apply either a test current and measure the resultant voltage, or apply a test voltage and measure the resultant current. $R_{th} = \frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}} $" (Source: \note{Note 15}).
