\qns{Resistors in Design}

You have been hired by “Next-Phone”, a promising startup that has developed a 3D printer to produce individually customized smartphones.\\
Only one problem remains: designing accurate position sensing for the printhead. “No problem,” you tell your new boss, “I’ll take care of that!”\\
The following figure shows your design. The printhead is supported by two rollers that move the head in the x direction. Each roller runs on two conductive tracks with resistivities $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$, respectively, length L, and cross-sectional area A. The rollers are made of metal electrically connecting the strips. The printhead is an insulator (i.e., non-conductive material) so it can be modeled as an open circuit. Roller 1 and Roller 2 are disconnected by the non-conductive Print Head.\\
You connect two voltage sources of voltage $V_S$ as shown in the figure below. You then measure voltage $V_{AB}=V_A-V_B$ to sense position x.\\

        Since $V_{A'}$ is open, there could be no current flowing between nodes $V_A$ and $V_{A'}$; therefore, $V_{AA'} = 0$.\\
        The same applies to $V_{BB'} = 0$.

    \item\label{design_system_analysis}{
        Find the value of voltage $V_{AB}(x_{pos}) = V_A - V_B$ for the following values: $V_S = 10V$, $\rho_1 = 1\Omega m$, $\rho_2 = 2\Omega m$, $L = 200mm$, $A = 1cm^{2}$, and $x_{pos} = 50mm$.

        This question comes from Q5(c) of Fall 2019's Midterm 2.
    
    }
    \ans{
        Via part (b), we know that $V_A = V_{A'}$, and via part (a)'s graphics we know that $V_A$ is involved in a voltage divider such that:
        \[V_A = \frac{R_{A_2}}{R_{A_1} + R_{A_2}}V_S\]
        where,
        \[\begin{cases}
            R_{A_1} = \frac{\rho_2 x_{pos}}{L} \\
            R_{A_2} = \frac{\rho_2 (L - x_{pos})}{L}
        \end{cases}\]
        By substituting the resistances into $V_A$'s computation, we acquire:
        \[V_A = \frac{L - x_{pos}}{L}V_S\]
        
        Now, via part (b), we also know that $V_B = V_{B'}$, and via part (a)'s graphics we know that $V_B$ is involved in a voltage divider such that:
        \[V_B = \frac{R_{B_2}}{R_{B_1} + R_{B_2}}V_S\]
        where,
        \[\begin{cases}
            R_{B_1} = \frac{\rho_1 (L - x_{pos})}{L} \\
            R_{B_2} = \frac{\rho_1 x_{pos}}{L}
        \end{cases}\]
        By substituting the resistances into $V_B$'s computation, we acquire:
        \[V_B = \frac{L - x_{pos}}{L}V_S\]
        So, provided the above analyses and substituting the prompt's values:
        \begin{align*}
            V_{AB}
            &= V_A - V_B \\
            &= \frac{L - 2x_{pos}}{L}V_S = 5V
        \end{align*}
    
    }
\end{enumerate}
